description: Returns a specified number of rows
explanation: |
  take (also known as limit) returns up to the specified number of rows from the result set.
  The order of rows is not guaranteed unless you use sort/order before take. This operator is commonly used for sampling data or limiting large result sets.
  Use take for quick data exploration or when you only need a subset of results.

  - query: | 
      DeviceProcessEvents
