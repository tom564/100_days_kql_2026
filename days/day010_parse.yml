description: Extracts structured data from strings
explanation: |
  parse extracts values from string fields using patterns. It's useful for parsing semi-structured text like logs, command lines, or file paths.
  Use simple mode for basic pattern matching or regex mode for complex extractions. Parse creates new columns from the extracted values.
  For repeated or performance-critical parsing, consider using parse-where or extract functions instead.
examples:
  - query: | 
      DeviceProcessEvents
      | parse ProcessCommandLine with "powershell.exe -" Flag " " ScriptPath
    description: >
      Extracts the flag and script path from PowerShell command lines.
  - query: | 
      SecurityEvent
      | parse EventData with * '<Data Name="TargetUserName">' UserName '</Data>' *
    description: >
      Extracts the target username from XML-formatted event data.
  - query: | 
      Syslog
      | parse kind=regex SyslogMessage with "User " User:string " from " IPAddress:string
    description: >
      Uses regex mode to extract user and IP address from syslog messages.
