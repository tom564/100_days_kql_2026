description: Combines rows from multiple tables
explanation: |
  union combines rows from two or more tables into a single result set. All tables should have compatible schemas, but union will include all columns from all tables.
  Use 'kind=inner' to include only columns common to all tables, or 'kind=outer' (default) to include all columns. The 'withsource' parameter adds a column indicating the source table.
examples:
  - query: | 
      union DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents
      | take 100
    description: >
      Combines process and network events into a single result set.
  - query: | 
      union withsource=TableName SecurityEvent, Syslog
      | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
    description: >
      Combines security events and syslog with a source column, filtered to the last hour.
  - query: | 
      union kind=inner 
        (SecurityEvent | project TimeGenerated, Computer, EventID),
        (Syslog | project TimeGenerated, Computer, Facility)
    description: >
      Inner union keeping only common columns (TimeGenerated, Computer).
